# Fundamental Machine Learning – Research Projects

This repository contains small-scale, hypothesis-driven experiments focused on fundamental properties of deep learning models, including representation stability, information loss, and failure analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Representation Stability under Input Perturbations
Study of how convolutional representations degrade under controlled Gaussian noise, analyzed across network depth using cosine similarity.

### 2. Pooling-Induced Information Loss
Controlled comparison of max pooling and average pooling to analyze their effect on feature variance and information preservation.

Each project is implemented as a self-contained notebook with accompanying analysis and documented limitations.
